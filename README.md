# fdf
3D visualization of heightmaps

usage: fdf map_file

FdF reads files of heightmaps, represented by table of numbers. For each number:

* The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
  
* The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
  
* The value corresponds to its altitude.
  
Example maps can be found in 'maps' directory.

FdF then outputs fully rotatable and scalable colored 3D representation of the map.
